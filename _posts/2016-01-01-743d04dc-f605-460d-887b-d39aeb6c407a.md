New Years Eve........ 

It's a calm night for us again this year,  the kids finished the Netflix "fake"  countdown and are tucked into bed. We'll be in bed before 11pm. No reason to start the new year exhausted and ornery. Kids have a way of sniffing out the nights that parents want to have a bit of fun and crush all the want and desire out of attempting those evenings. The last 2 times we've made it out of the house the kiddos are wide awake when we return home. Really takes the wind out of our sails. 

Then there are the equally as fantastic microscopic events that make everyone of those days worth it. Today I watched my daughter (let's call her A and for future reference my son will be F). Her and I have been practising our handstands. She's getting so good at them, her issue which I am just as guilty.... Not waiting between them,  just continually trying til I fail hard or I win however rare that is. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2441b041-d9a6-4541-80a7-a8a8c0975157.jpg)
